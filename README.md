# demo

Requirements:
1.	The demo has a basic user sign up and login functions
2.	The demo works on the count of pea (use Tensorflow Lite model)
3.	Other functions that it would be useful for the app.

Finally, the model output is required to be passed to the non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm. The output of NMS is in the shape of (1000, 6) where 1000 is the number of filtered detected peas and 6 = (xleft_coordinate, ytop_coordinate, xright_coordinate, ybottom_coordinate, confidence, class.
